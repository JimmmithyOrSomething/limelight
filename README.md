Glasses with built in EEG and EMG

I built this because I've always been so interested by our brains, our whole world and everything we know is a constuction of how they process senses and even in this small way I want to learn more about how they work.

description: "This project is a wearable EEG and EMG that I'm building from scratch. Most devices like this are very expensive so I wanted to see if I can make one device for both EEG and EMG signals and use it to get wave data or prefore actions (ex: light turns on when you tense your arm)"
