Limelight is a project I have been working on for the last few months, this is an EEG/EMG device that should be able to read wave signals from both sides of the brain as well as two points of muscle on the body. This will be able to preform actions such as any computer or microcontroler input via muscle movements as well as giving me data from the brain for other science projects I'm working on. I the whole device is built around 4 OP-amp PCBs and 12 electrodes. Beucase I need to order 5 PCBs I figured that I would leave out some resistors and caps that define how much the amp increses this way I can usse the same board for the very diffrent EEG and EMG signals. For the EEG all the electrodes are built into a pair of glasses with 6 pads comming off of it to capture data which is delivered as 2 signals to an ESP board where an FFT can be run to get two Hz values to give information om what the brain is doing. As for the muscle 6 electrodes will be placed which gives two signals that can be used for both research and technical projects. The system runs on an ESP board running custom firmware with an FTT able to convert signals into Hz values.
